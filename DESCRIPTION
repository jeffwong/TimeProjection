Title: Time Projections
Description: Extract useful time components of a date object, such as day of
    week, weekend, holiday, day of month, etc, and put it in a data frame.
    This can be used to create many predictor variables out of a single time
    variable, which can then be used in a regression or decision tree.  Also
    includes function plotCalendarHeatmap which draws a calendar and
    overlays a heatmap based on values.
